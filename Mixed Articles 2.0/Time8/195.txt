Disney CEO Bob Iger Comments on Marvel Theme Park Rights in Florida 
April 3, 2023 
Shannen Michaelsen  


Responding to a shareholder’s question regarding Marvel theme park rights, The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said they would “love” to do more with Marvel in the parks but refused to comment further.

Iger said, “We certainly would love to be able to do more with Marvel in our parks, but I’ll leave it at that.”
Disney has Marvel Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure and Disneyland Paris. In Florida, Disney is unable to build any kind of Marvel theme park or land due to Universal having the rights. Universal’s Islands of Adventure has Marvel Super Heroes Island.
Universal owns the theme park rights east of the Mississippi in perpetuity, including characters represented in the park who are park of the Avengers, X-Men, and Fantastic Four families. You can read the full contract here. 
Disney is able to utilize the Guardians of the Galaxy in Walt Disney World, most notably with Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. Though they have now been in Avengers-branded movies, the Guardians do not fall under the Avengers umbrella as pertaining to the terms of the contract.
