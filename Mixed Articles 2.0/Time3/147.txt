We managed to stay in the vicinity of the formation until the French coast was reached.""Lt. Montgomery is no longer missing." He continued, "I went to the flight deck and only one rudder and one elevator was in working order. We were in the rear of the ship until almost at the English coast when the order came to bail out."
