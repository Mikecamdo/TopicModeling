These teams are each 4-2 thanks to having two of the best three offenses in the XFL. Houston ranks second at 27.0 ppg, and St. Louis isn't far behind at 23.2. The Roughnecks are more pass-heavy behind Brandon Silvers, while St. Louis has leaned on Brian Hill, who ranks second in the league in rushing. This could be a high-scoring affair.
