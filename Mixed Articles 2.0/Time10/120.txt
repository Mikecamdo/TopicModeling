EventWidespread civil unrest related to pension reforms will likely continue causing nationwide disruptions through early April. Labor unions and activist groups are continuing a campaign of strike and protest action denouncing pension reform. The multi-sector union federation has announced an eleventh day of nationwide strikes on April 6.As of April 1, the European Organisation for Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) has stated that disruption from the ongoing air traffic controllers (ATC) strike will continue through at least 04:00 April 8. Flights will be disrupted at Paris-Orly Airport (ORY), Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS), Bordeaux-Merignac Airport (BOD), Marseille-Provence Airport (MRS), and Nantes-Antlantique Airport (NTE). The daily flight reductions are as follows:April 1: 20 percent reduction in flights at TLS and BODApril 2: 25 percent reduction in flights at ORY, 20 percent reduction at TLS, BOD, and NTEApril 3: 20 percent reduction in flights at BOD and MRSApril 4: 20 percent reduction in flights at ORY, BOD, and MRSFurther information regarding flight disruption on April 5-8 is expected in the coming days. Further short-notice cancelations and delays are possible throughout France during the strike period. The strike may be extended past April 8. Lingering disruptions are likely at affected airports following the conclusion of the strike as airlines reposition aircraft and crew and work through passenger backlogs.Continued disruptions following the nationwide strikes on March 28 and ongoing renewable strikes will likely cause lingering disruption through at least April 2. The national rail operator SNCF anticipates limited disruption April 1-2, but service delays and cancelations are possible. Similar disruptions are possible for the RATP services in Paris and other local public transport systems.Industrial action in oil refineries across France since March 7 is impacting fuel supplies. Some fuel service stations are experiencing fuel shortages, particularly in the south of France, the west, and Brittany. More severe shortages are possible in the coming days. While waste collectors in most cities have ended their industrial action, including in Paris, workers in some municipalities, including Saint-Brieuc and Le Havre, remain on strike. Uncollected waste is accumulating in some urban areas, posing a possible health hazard. Demonstrations are widespread and occur daily in most major cities, particularly Paris. Protesters can block major roads, typically ring roads close to major cities, and obstruct access to transport hubs such as bus and train depots. Clashes have broken out, and police have resorted to using teargas in several locations in recent days. Based on previous events, tens of thousands are likely to attend events across France on April 6. Specific demonstration locations are to be confirmed, but actions will likely occur in central squares and thoroughfares.The unrest shows no signs of abating, and the government has not indicated a willingness to abandon its pension reform initiative; hence, planned and spontaneous protests will probably continue through at least the beginning of April. Authorities will maintain an increased security presence near any demonstrations that materialize and near government buildings. Large crowds and associated security measures, including road closures and movement restrictions, will result in localized transport disruptions. Clashes between activists and security services are possible; riot police may use tear gas or similar measures to disperse unruly crowds.ContextDisruptive demonstrations broke out nationwide in reaction to the government invoking Article 49.3 of the French Constitution to pass the pension reform without requiring a vote in the National Assembly. The reform raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. The proposed amendment has prompted widespread civil unrest through early 2023. President Emanuel Macron's government has narrowly survived two no-confidence votes in the National Assembly in recent days, clearing the way for the bill to become law. Further protests are almost certain.AdviceConfirm all transport reservations as well as public- and private-sector appointments through early April, including at public health centers and other government facilities. Do not check out of accommodations until onward travel is confirmed. Avoid all demonstrations as a routine security precaution and to mitigate personal exposure to any associated disruptions. Allow extra time for travel in major cities. Heed instructions from local authorities and leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation.ResourcesSNCFRATPEurostar
