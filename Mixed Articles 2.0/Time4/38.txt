Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Set to Star in XFL: The Movie
Stephan Rachuk·April 1, 2023

The XFL returned last month after a nearly 3-year hiatus. Back in 2020 it seemed like nothing could stop the league. That was until COVID took the world by storm and forced the XFL into bankruptcy.

When it seemed there was no hope for a return a group of unlikely heros stepped out of the shadows to save the day. On August 3rd, 2020 it was announced that Dany Garcia, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and RedBird Capital had acquired the rights to the XFL.

It was a long road back to the field, but we’re now seven weeks into their comeback season.

The Rock and Garcia have not been shy about leveraging their existing brands with the reboot. We’ve even seen the duo during the league’s 9-part docu-series; Player 54: Chasing the XFL Dream. Now, it looks as if their taking things to the next level.

It was just announced on Twitter that Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson will be producing and starring in a movie about the XFL.

According to the press release on the films website (xflmovie.com), Teremana Presents XFL: The Movie | Sponsored by ZOA Energy is set debut this Christmas exclusively on FX.

The trailer also shows that there will be appearances by Jack Black and Kevin Hart, which are mainstays in a lot of The Rock’s feature films. Although it doesn’t say who they’ll be playing, we’d love to see Jack Black portray a portly Vince McMahon.

Needless to say, this is a huge way to kickoff the month of April.
