News on Marvel's Spider-Man 2, the highly anticipated follow-up to Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man from 2018 and 2020's Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, has been light since the game's reveal in 2021. But back in December, PlayStation did reveal that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 would be out sometime this Fall. 

According to the voice actor for Venom in the game, Tony Todd (who we heard briefly in the game's reveal trailer), Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be out this September. Strangely, Todd responded to a fan excited about the game and spilled the beans. 

"Looks like September! Massive publicity coming in august. Commercials start dropping in august so I'm told. Hold on to your...and hold breath! Gonna be necessary"

Sure seems like information Todd wasn't supposed to reveal, right? Despite what you might think, though, Todd's tweet is still up at the time of this writing, meaning Insomniac Games hasn't made him take it down (yet). 

Once people started to realize that Todd had potentially revealed Marvel's Spider-Man 2's release date, he cheekily tweeted the following: 

Now, it's important to note that just because Todd says the game is coming this September doesn't mean it actually is. We should remain cautious about an official release date or release month until it comes from developer Insomniac Games. But September lines up with the previously revealed Fall window.

A September release date would put this big PlayStation first-party launch up against Xbox's big first-party launch in Starfield (September 6) so this Fall could be quite busy.
