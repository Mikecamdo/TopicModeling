CHARLOTTE — Marvel fans can channel their inner superpowers when a new exhibit opens at Discovery Place Science this spring.

“Marvel: Universe of Super Heroes” lands in Uptown on May 14 and will feature more than 300 original artifacts, including some of Marvel’s most iconic costumes, props and original art, much of which has never before been put on public display.

The exhibition celebrates more than eight decades of Marvel’s iconic characters in print, film and other media. Visitors will have the opportunity to travel through the mysterious mirror dimension of Doctor Strange; get up-close glimpses at concept sketches, props, and costumes from Marvel Studios blockbusters; pose for selfies alongside life-size representations of Black Panther, Spider-Man, and other characters; see the original art from some of Marvel’s most notable comics; and even step into Tony Stark’s lab to test the capabilities of the Iron Man armor for themselves.

“Our show begins with the origins of the Marvel Universe and moves through to the present day, giving a chance to see some of the rarest and most precious objects from the past 80 years of pop culture history, and pointing toward the future with work from some of today’s foremost creators,” curator Ben Saunders said in a news release.

This will be the exhibition’s only stop in the Southeast and the last stop in the U.S. before heading to Europe.

“Marvel: Universe of Super Heroes” will be on display through Sept. 4.

Tickets for the exhibition go on sale on March 23.
