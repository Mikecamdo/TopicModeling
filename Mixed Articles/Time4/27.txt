CLEVELAND, Ohio - Age is but a number for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.

Goodell, who is 64, is set to surpass the age of his predecessor, Paul Tagliabue, who was 65 when he stepped down. That’s thanks to a likely multiyear contract extension that’s in the works and set to be finalized at next week’s NFL owners meetings in Phoenix, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.

Schefter reported on Tuesday that this extension has been in the works dating back to last season, and that it appears to be a three-year deal, although he added that hasn’t been confirmed. The Washington Post’s Mark Maske later reported that the extension is set to run through 2027.


The NFL declined to comment to Maske and Schefter.


This would mark the fourth extension for Goodell, who’s been the league’s commissioner since Sep. 1, 2006, after taking over for Tagliabue. According to Schefter, this is believed to be the final extension for Goodell, adding that there will be an added emphasis on finding his possible successor once that extension is up.

Goodell’s current deal runs through next March. Twenty-four of the league’s 32 owners must vote in favor of the extension in order for it to gain approval.
