XFL notebook: Once unbeaten, Roughnecks return in need of victory

The Houston Roughnecks are back at TDECU Stadium for the first time in a month, hosting the St. Louis Battlehawks at 2 p.m. Sunday. They return on a different trajectory than when they left.

Once undefeated, Houston followed a 21-14 loss at Seattle with a 37-26 loss Monday at D.C. The Defenders (6-0) remained the lone undefeated team in the XFL.

The leading rushing team in the XFL by a wide margin, D.C. controlled the ball through the air against Houston, with Jordan Ta'amu completing 19 of 31 passes for 245 and two touchdowns. Abram Smith added a touchdown and 95 yards to his league-high rushing total, while Lucky Jackson's 136 yards and a touchdown led all receivers.
