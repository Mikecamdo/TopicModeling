St. Louis Battlehawks post April Fools' Day joke that doesn't go over well

Humorous posts were trending on social media platforms over the weekend in honor of Saturday being April Fools' Day.

But a post from the XFL's St. Louis Battlehawks that went out with the April 1 parody posts didn't go over well with fans. That's because they announced the team was moving to Los Angeles.

The post referenced the NFL's Rams that left St. Louis after the 2015 season to return to Los Angeles after a 20-year run in Gateway City. It read just like an actual press release and that's probably what set off a few unappreciated responses. 

Even Battlehawks head coach Anthony Becht, who played for the St. Louis Rams in 2008, posted his displeasure of the post to Twitter.

Steve's Hot Dogs, a popular St. Louis eatery owned by Steve Ewing of '90s alternative rock band The Urge, posted a GIF that likely summed up every St. Louis sports fan's initial reaction.

Every day sports journalists in St. Louis didn't care much for it either.
