When PLANET OF THE APES (2023) #1 kicks off, the ALZ-113 virus has rampaged across planet Earth, and humanity is crumbling. While well-meaning researchers hunt for a cure, a fanatical group of humans has their own solution: kill all apes. Peacekeeper Juliana Tobon is one of the few willing to stand against them, but the crisis is spreading, and soon apes will witness the true depths of human cruelty…
Eisner-winning writer David F. Walker joins forces with artist Dave Wachter on one of the most beloved sci-fi franchises in history with PLANET OF THE APES (2023) #1, on sale this Wednesday, April 5!
PLANET OF THE APES (2023) #1 cover by Joshua CassaraThis week's comics will also introduce Spider-Man’s long-lost sidekick: Spider-Boy! "The End of the Spider-Verse" is here in Dan Slott and Mark Bagley’s SPIDER-MAN #7. Friends became enemies. Enemies became friends. And now, all of the Spider-Verse ends! Jessica Drew? Gone. Peter Parker? Gone. They are not the only ones erased by the sacred Sting-Knife. How can Silk and the rest of the Spiders win this Spider-War?!
And that's not the only Spider adventure going down this week! THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2022) opened with a question: what did Peter do?! The centerpiece of the answer is a flat-out fight that will be revealed in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (2022) #23 by Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr.
Likewise, Steve Orlando and Sara Pichelli's SCARLET WITCH (2023) #4 will reveal the mystery behind Darcy Lewis, the Scarlet Witch's shopkeeper. Darcy has a secret—and when the consequences of that secret result in the annihilation of Wanda's shop, Wanda Maximoff must choose between protecting her new life or saving her friend's. Scarlet Witch faces Scythia, leader of the Bacchae, in a battle to answer the question: What does it mean to enact justice?
Meanwhile, SINS OF SINISTER continues in IMMORAL X-MEN (2023) #3 by Kieron Gillen and Alessandro Vitti. Year 1 was the start of the experiment. By Year 10, it was filling a petri dish. By Year 100, it had cracked the glass and spread across the desk. Now it's been 1000 years, and the lab is filled by the writhing, pulsing sins of Sinister and all the lab staff have been devoured. Everyone is in hell. The upside: this includes Sinister.
Then, CAPTAIN AMERICA: COLD WAR begins in Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, and Carmen Carnero's CAPTAIN AMERICA: SENTINEL OF LIBERTY (2022) #11. Captain America and the new Invaders may be free from M.O.D.O.C.’s mind control, but they are not yet guaranteed their lives, and with the battle nearly won, the Outer Circle have arrived on the ground to collect their prize. It’s up to Steve Rogers to wrestle victory from the Power and finally end the Outer Circle’s invasion of Manhattan—but choices made at this critical point will alter Steve’s understanding of friendship and the stakes of his fight against the Outer Circle for good.
Meet Spider-Boy, uncover the mystery of Darcy Lewis, witness the start to CAPTAIN AMERICA: COLD WAR, and more by picking up the latest titles this week! From fresh comics to collections and even Marvel Unlimited, find the full list of new releases here!
