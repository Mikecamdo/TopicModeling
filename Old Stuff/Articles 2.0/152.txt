 OTTERVILLE — A World War II time machine rolled through Jersey and Calhoun counties on Saturday as the Odd Ball Express — a collection of vintage military Jeeps driven by authentically-uniformed and equipped GI re-enactors — slowly wound its way down the region’s back roads.
The four-Jeep convoy turned a lot of heads and sparked lively conversations when the re-enactors stopped in several small towns along the way, or boarded ferries for river crossings.
 The Jersey County community of Otterville was one of the convoy’s first stops on what turned out to be a cold and windy day to be driving the open-air vehicles.




 “It’s a stiff ride — no heat, no air, no luxuries — so it’s pretty rough on a day like this,” said Brian Stacks of Moro. “My dad was in World War II and, like most GIs, learned to drive in a Jeep. He was an officer in the Pacific and I inherited a lot of his stuff. And that why I’m here today.”
Edwardsville resident Jeffrey Germer was also honoring his father’s service by driving a Jeep in the Odd Ball Express.
“My dad was a World War II vet and we were going to take him on an honor flight in 2006 to Washington, D.C., to see the World War II Memorial dedication,” Germer said. “He couldn’t make it. So I took my two daughters and my mom went with us.
“I met up with some living history re-enactors there and they were doing a lot of outreach, showing equipment and vehicles,” Germer said. “That’s how I go interested. I wanted to carry the message and that’s what we’re doing today.” 
The Odd Ball Express was organized by the U.S. 2nd Ranger Infantry Battalion of St. Louis, a World War II re-enactment unit dedicated to preserving the military history and honoring the veterans of the U.S. armed forces. The re-enactors do not have any actual affiliation with the current U.S. Army Rangers but pay homage to D Company of the U.S. 2nd Ranger Battalion.
“Right now it’s freezing cold. But if the 2nd Rangers could deal with it during World War II, we can too,” said Odd Ball Express organizer John Pietrusinski. “Driving this Jeep is a lot of fun. It's a heck of a feeling; it’s an American icon.”

 The Odd Ball Express made stops Saturday in Grafton, Otterville, Pere Marquette State Park, the Brussels Ferry, Brussels, Golden Eagle Ferry, and the Smartt Field Commemorative Air Force Museum in St. Charles County, Missouri.
The unit the re-enactors portray was involved in the D-Day invasion on June 6, 1944. The men of D Company were among 225 Rangers who landed at the base of cliffs at Pointe du Hoc and scaled the cliffs under heavy fire using rope ladders. After two days of relentless fighting, only 90 Rangers were still able to bear arms against the German army.
The vehicles driven by the Odd Ball Express on Saturday have their own storied history. The name “Jeep” comes from the letters GP, the military abbreviation for “general purpose.” The go-anywhere, do-anything vehicles produced by Willys-Overland Motors went everywhere the United States military went during World War II.
According to the history section of the modern Jeep vehicles brand website, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. George C. Marshall described the Jeep as "America's greatest contribution to modern warfare." World War II reporter Ernie Pyle once said, "It did everything. It went everywhere. Was a faithful as a dog, as strong as a mule, and as agile as a goat. It constantly carried twice what it was designed for and still kept going."
