Former Alabama QB AJ McCarron continues to impress in the XFL

It has not been smooth sailing for former Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron since he departed Tuscaloosa in 2014. The Alabama native has had his ups and downs but has found a good spot for himself.

McCarron is currently the quarterback for the St. Louis Battlehawks of the newly-formed XFL. The former Alabama signal-caller has been the team’s starting quarterback since the season kicked off in late February.

He has made seven starts for the Battlehawks and has helped the team win consistently. The Battlehawks are currently 5-2 and sit in second place in the XFL North.

McCarron has led the way having passed for 1,544 yards while completing 68.9% of the passes he has thrown. He also has thrown an impressive 17 touchdowns with just four interceptions on the year.

Despite McCarron turning 33 years old in September, he could make a return to the NFL. In all likelihood, he would serve as a team’s backup quarterback.

Roll Tide Wire will continue to follow McCarron’s professional career as well as other former Alabama players competing at the professional level.
