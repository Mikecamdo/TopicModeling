				Fenwick Strengthens Privacy and Cybersecurity Practice with Arrival of Partner Michael Sussmann
			















Fenwick today announced that Michael Sussmann has joined the firm as a partner in its privacy and cybersecurity practice in Washington, DC.
Sussmann is an internationally recognized privacy, cybersecurity and national security attorney and a former federal cybercrime prosecutor. With over 25 years practicing in this field, he advises clients on a range of sophisticated and high-stakes matters, taking on unprecedented state-sponsored network intrusions and data breaches, sensitive government investigations, and other bet-the-company representations.
“We are thrilled to welcome Michael to our partnership,” said Fenwick Chair Richard Dickson. “His renowned privacy and data security expertise coupled with his deep experience in both the private and public sectors brings an unmatched resource to all of our clients.”
With each new advance in communications technology and data uses, clients trust Sussmann to help them navigate laws related to data collection, access and sharing, and the legal risks presented in an evolving landscape. He has conducted extensive privacy and cybersecurity reviews for Fortune 100 companies, represented them before the Department of Justice, FTC, state attorneys general, and other regulators, provided Congressional testimony, and litigated national security cases in federal court.
“The proliferation of privacy and cybersecurity risks and the increasing number of international regulations in these areas expose our clients to many complex and unprecedented issues around the protection and use of data,” added Tyler Newby, head of the firm's IP and complex litigation practice and partner in the privacy and cybersecurity practice. "Michael’s deep experience is a timely addition as our team continues to help clients navigate the constantly evolving challenges ahead.”
Earlier in his career, Sussmann spent 12 years in several positions within the DOJ. He joined the Department in 1993 as Special Assistant to the Assistant Attorney General for DOJ’s Criminal Division; he prosecuted white-collar and violent crimes at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia; and his government service concluded with his eight years in DOJ’s Computer Crime & Intellectual Property Section. Prior to that, he practiced in New York at a large firm.
“Fenwick’s reputation for excellence and its track record with some of the biggest global innovators made joining the firm a natural choice,” Sussmann said. “I am thrilled to team with such a respected group of partners and associates, including its impressive privacy and cybersecurity experts.”
Sussmann’s arrival reaffirms Fenwick’s continued investment in its regulatory and privacy and cybersecurity practices as well as the expansion of its Washington, DC office. In late 2021, trade and national security partner Melissa Duffy and antitrust partners Tom Ensign and Steve Albertson joined the firm and helped launch Fenwick’s DC office. In 2022, government contracts partners Joyce Tong Oelrich and Zohra Tejani joined the DC office, and the firm expanded its regulatory capabilities in California by welcoming Santa Monica-based healthcare regulatory partner Jennifer Yoo. Earlier this year, Fenwick welcomed trade and national security partner Rob Slack in DC, and last week corporate regulatory partner Heidi Lawson joined the firm in New York.
