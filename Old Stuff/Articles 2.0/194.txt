Marvel teases a ‚Äòfallen friend‚Äô will be featured in new one-shot in July 2023
Marvel teaser to be revealed May 31st.



 


ByDavid Brooke


on April 3, 2023





























Marvel Comics has released a new teaser that‚Äôs very cryptic but promises to have everyone talking leading up to the full reveal on May 31st. The graphic is simple, detailing Fallen Friend #1 will be released in July, and it‚Äôll be heartbreaking.
The last time Marvel teased something heartbreaking was in regard to Spider-Man. The ‚Äúmost shocking issue of Amazing Spider-Man in 50 years‚Äù is coming out this May. Taking place in Amazing Spider-Man #25 and #26, both issues will be oversized, featuring art by Romita Jr., Kaare Andrews, and more. Could this teaser be about the fallout from that?


Listen to the latest episode of our weekly comics podcast!

Is it also a coincidence I postulated Norman Osborn was the one to die in the upcoming Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. story arc and he‚Äôs also Spider-Man‚Äôs ‚Äúonly friend‚Äù right now? More on that here.
Check out the teaser below.

THIS JULY‚Ä¶ FALLEN FRIEND #1
A heartbreaking one-shot in July‚Ä¶
Learn who it will spotlight on May 31.
Stay tuned to AIPT as we‚Äôll have up-to-the-minute reporting on this tantalizing teaser.
