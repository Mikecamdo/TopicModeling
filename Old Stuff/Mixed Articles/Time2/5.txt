Peter Parker and Miles Morales may be swinging back into action in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 this September. While no release month has been officially announced, Venom voice actor Tony Todd might have just let word slip on the PlayStation 5 exclusive's launch plans.

On Twitter, Todd showcased that he was inside a "mocap mainframe," presumably for Spider-Man 2. Then, in a reply to someone expressing their excitement for the sequel, Todd apparently revealed September as the target month for release. "Looks like September! Massive publicity coming in August," wrote Todd, who's known for the Candyman film franchise as well.

Looks like September! Massive publicity coming in august. Commercials start dropping in august so I’m told. Hold on to your … and hold breath! Gonna be necessary

In December, Sony shared that Spider-Man 2 was planned to launch in the fall of this year. The PS5 game takes place after the events of Spider-Man and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. A couple of months earlier, developer Insomniac Games reinforced that the game was making "good progress" and on track for a 2023 release.

Spider-Man 2 has been compared to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back by Marvel Games vice president creative Bill Rosemann previously. He added that this title "gets a little darker." The sequel was first unveiled back in 2021.

Insomniac is also working on Marvel's Wolverine, which will be mature in tone.
