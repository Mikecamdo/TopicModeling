Today’s minor moves:

Carolina Panthers

Re-signed: DL Henry Anderson
Cleveland Browns

Signed: LB Matthew Adams
Dallas Cowboys

Signed: OL Chuma Edoga
Re-signed: RB Rico Dowdle
Minnesota Vikings

Waived: WR Thomas Hennigan
Adams, a former seventh-round pick, collected 55 tackles across 58 games (nine starts) with the Colts to begin his career. He spent the 2022 campaign in Chicago, compiling 26 tackles in 10 games (three starts).

The Cowboys previously tried to trade for Edoga, so it’s not a surprise that he’s finally landed in Dallas. Per Nick Eatman of the team’s website, the lineman could be a candidate to start at left guard to replace Connor McGovern. The former third-round pick has only appeared in seven games over the past two seasons in stints with the Jets and Falcons.

Anderson hasn’t started a game since the 2020 season, but he can still be a reliable special teamer and situational defender for a rebooted Panthers squad. The veteran got into 11 games for the Colts last season, collecting 18 tackles.
