Morgan Wallen is on his way to New Zealand to kick off his world tour, “One Night At A Time,” next week (3/15), and he is not leaving a girlfriend at home. He is single. Morgan said in a recent interview, “I had a girlfriend for a while. Not recently. That was the last one I had. I don’t have anybody right now. It’s kind of hard. Just how busy I’ve been. I got a son; an album; a tour; I’ve got all these things I do.”

He added, “It’s really hard for me to make time for that. I want to, though. I think I’m coming up on my ‘settle down phase.’ We’ll see. I’m not in a hurry.”

Wallen recently announced that due to popular demand, he is adding a one-night-only show at London’s The O2 on December 3, 2023. After ten days in Australia and New Zealand, he will return on April 14 at Milwaukee’s American Family Field with HARDY, hitting New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium, Chicago’s Wrigley Field, and Boston’s Fenway Park with Parker McCollum. He will play in the U.S. and Canada till he flies to London in December.

Miranda Lambert recently congratulated Morgan on the number-one success of a song called “Thought You Should Know” that she co-wrote with Morgan.

Miranda posted to Instagram a black and white photo of herself, Wallen, and the song’s third co-writer, Nicolle Galyon. She captioned the post, “Congrats @morganwallen on your number 1 song “Thought You Should Know.” Proud to be a writer on a song about your mama! This is the first number 1 song I’ve ever had as a writer. We did good that day y’all. Cheers friends. @nicatnitemusic.”


The chorus goes, “I thought you should know / That all those prayers you thought you wasted on me / Must’ve finally made their way on through / I thought you should know / I got me a new girl down there in Jefferson City, and / She lets me fish whenever I want to / Yeah, I’m still proud of where I came from / Still your only damn son / Can you believe I’m on the radio? / Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know.”
