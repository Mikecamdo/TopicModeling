The Denver Broncos had a formal interview with Pittsburgh running back Israel Abanikanda at the NFL combine earlier this offseason, according to The Draft Networkâ€™s Ryan Fowler. NFL teams are allowed to have up to 45 formal visits with players at the combine each year.

Abanikanda (5-10, 216 pounds) had a breakout season as a junior last fall, rushing 239 times for 1,431 yards and 20 touchdowns in 11 games with the Panthers. He also hauled in 12 receptions for 146 yards and another score.

Most mock drafts have Abanikanda going off the board in the fourth round. Denver currently holds pick No. 108 overall in the fourth round.

If selected by the Broncos, Abanikanda would join a running back room that includes Javonte Williams, Samaje Perine, Damarea Crockett, Tyreik McAllister and Tyler Badie. With Williams facing an uncertain recovery timeline, Denver is expected to add at least one more running back this offseason.

The 2023 NFL draft will be held in Kansas City from April 27-29.
