After a big opening last week, the country star Morgan Wallen easily takes No. 1 again with his latest album, “One Thing at a Time,” holding off new releases from Miley Cyrus and the K-pop group Twice.

The 36-track “One Thing at a Time” tops the Billboard 200 chart with the equivalent of 259,000 sales in the United States, including 308 million streams and 21,000 copies sold as a complete package, according to the tracking service Luminate.

Its total is down 48 percent from last week, when it started with 501,000. But “One Thing at a Time” still had the second-best streaming week ever for a country album, topping even the debut of Wallen’s last blockbuster album, “Dangerous: The Double Album,” more than two years ago. (“Dangerous” remains a hit, landing at No. 7 this week.)

Twice, which comprises nine women, opens at No. 2 — a new peak for the group — with “Ready to Be,” a seven-track EP. It had the equivalent of 153,000 sales, mostly from copies sold as a complete package, of which there were a variety of collectible offerings on physical media, including 11 CD versions and two vinyl LPs. Of the 145,500 copies of “Ready to Be” sold as complete units, 86 percent were on CD, according to Billboard. Songs from “Ready to Be” were also streamed 10 million times.
